1 - first of all we must init the folder that hold this certificates 
    mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
2 - give this folder the required permissions
    chmod   700 /etc/nginx/ssl


--------------------- CEARTE CERTIFICATE------------------------------------------

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/inception.key \
        -out /etc/nginx/ssl/inception.crt -subj "/C=MA/L=BENGUERIR/O=1337/OU=1337/CN=aelkhali.42.fr/UID=aelkhali"

openssl documentation :
    -x509 option is used togenerate a self-signed certificate.
    -subj "/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=value2/..."
        each type-value pair represents a component of the distinguished name. The common types include:
        /C=: Country Name (e.g., US for the United States).
        /L=: Locality Name (City).
        /ST=: State or Province Name.
        /O=: Organization Name.
        /OU=: Organizational Unit Name.
        /CN=: Common Name (typically the fully qualified domain name for SSL/TLS certificates).

    -nodes option in OpenSSL is used to indicate that the private key file being created should not be encrypted with a passphrase.
    <Keep in mind that using the -nodes option means that anyone with access to the private key file can use it without providing a passphrase. 
    Therefore, you should be cautious when using unencrypted private keys, especially in production environments or when dealing with sensitive 
    information. If security is a concern, it's generally better to use passphrase-protected private keys and implement secure key management practices.>

----------------------- END CREATING THE CERTIFICATE-----------------------------

now we make nginx ready to accept those keys and use them by telling him to check the new config file

1- create a config file inside -> /etc/nginx/conf.d/test.conf
2- add this two directives to your config file:
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;

an example config file to base on :

    server
    {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name aelkhali.42.fr;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.key;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;

        root /var/www/;

        location / {
            root /var/www/;
            index index.php;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
        }
    }
