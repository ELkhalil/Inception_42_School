1 - understanding docker:
--------------------------
->  First of all what is the problem we are trying to solve (i mean why there is a docker...)
        well u must know that there is a problem realeted to the software industry
    problem:
    ----------
        ->  Suppose you are trying to join a new company (suppose it is a product delivery app company)
            they introduce you with the technologies they are using in their app 
            for example:
                backend : PHP, Laravel, PostgreesSQL, PostGIS, and Redis
                Frontend: Javascript and Angular 4
            -> Basically to join the team and be able to work with them you must install the previous plugins and packages.
                - first thing you will face is the installation Errors, version error, compatibility errors...
                - let's go for the worst case scenario u face some issues u ask the teams they forget how they solved it 
                  u must ask more to know the solution and it may not work.
                - downgrade package versions so you can run the app... it's getting even worse. 
            -> After all the previous problems u solved now when you make some changes to the app and ur trying to deploy it for 
               testing, Staging and production... THEY MUST GO THROUGH UR PREVIOUS PROBLEMS...
    What / Why Docker ?
    --------------------
    why that logo ?
        -> suppose you have a cargo ship. to make the delivery they organize the commodities inside something called containers
           the DOCKER in this idea play the role of the Cargo Shp holding container of apps.
    Summury :
        DOCKER :
            -> is a technology that help you transfer your application from one envirenement to another one.

How Docker Works?
-----------------
    docker uses the linux kernel mainly, specifically the Cgroups (constrol groups) 
    Cgroups : they manage kernel ressources (CPU|GPU|RAM|IO...)
    Basically docker tell the kernel through the Cgroups its need of recourses.

    The second thing is NameSpace:
    -------------------------------
    it allows to abstract the container or hide it, it is like using nnamespace in c++.

Part 1:
-------
    -> History and Motivation
    but it work on my machine sir 
    why not ship your machine ?.. this is how docker was born (by shipping the local...)

Containers Motivation:
                    Developement                           |              Deployement
    _> "to get the dev env set up installs                 |    "to deploy ur app on  a server u must install
       x softwares ... and scripts, wait i use windows     |     the dependencies and configure the system, then copy
       well thats differente ..."                          |     the Deployement binary and run it with some options"
                                                           |
    _> "Run docker compose up"                             |      _> Run this container image with these options

_> "you can look at a container as if it is an instance from an image because once an image is running it becomes a container"

Virtualisation  vs Containerisation
_> The big difference is in security and isolation as Virtualisation is very safe because it does not share the operating system
   instead of the Containerisation witch happen to share the same files after all.
_> The speed of containers is very remarkable as it is very light weight.

Docker Hub :
------------
_> is a wharehouse for images but they are public any one can access it and pull it from it.
_> you can make your own Docker rÆ’egistry witch is private...(like Gitlab...)

DOCKER ARCHITECTURE
-------------------
Server docker daemon(DOCKER ENGINE)    ->      REST API    -> Client docker CLI (command line interface)

DOCKER COMMANDS:
----------------
    "docker rmi imageName/first 3 doigit from id"   -> to remove an image.
    "docker rmi imageName --force"                  -> u can't delete a running image u must use the force option.
    "docker stop ContainerName or id"               -> to stop a running container.
    "docker ps || docker ps --all"                  -> display the current running containers.
    "docker stop ContainerName"                         
    "docker start"                                  -> to run a stoped container.

    Docker run[OPTIONS] IMAGE:[TAG]
        --name      -> to give the image a TAG
        -p          ->
        -d          ->
        -it         ->
        -e          ->

Docker registries ?
---------------------
    _> where images are stored and gets updates so world and community can pull and upload their own (like github with codes)
    EXAMPLES:   docker hub (privare/public)

HOW CAN I MAKE MY OWN DOCKER IMAGE ??
--------------------------------------
    
DOCKER VOLUMES:
----------------
    _> maps files and directories inside container to ones on the host OS.
    _> persists data at container disposal.
    _> USE CASES:
        1 - File Upload
        2 - COnfiguration sync
    
THE PROCESS OF DOCKERIZING AN APP?
------------------------------------

1- do i need to copy all files ?
    _> there is some files u won't need it at all inside the container those files we can place them inside 
       a (.) ignore file .dockerignore -> and tell him what you do not want it to copy.

2- Why did we split "package.json" copy command ?
    _> to outline the files that must be recopied every time and to understand the cash of docker.

Section 3:
----------
    _> using docker in Local Development and Hot-Reload
        once we make the copy of a file the docker is unable to know if we change that file in the host machine 
        as it is already copied to the container. WE SOLVE IT USING HOT_RELOAD
        _> we add a new flag while running docker (Solution)
    _> HOT_RELOAD has an issue -> if anything happened inside the container it will be merrored to the host data.

Docker Volumes:
---------------
volumes inside docker are just processes that are running in memory, if you do not save data inside the drive it will be lost
    -> TWO WAY BINDING
        ($PWD -v)
        _> there is multiple types of volumes we already used the (bind mount = linking two thing between each other) mode 
            witch poped the issue of reflecting a change to the host file.
    _> ONE WAY BINDING
        ($PWD -v:ro)
        _> if something happened inside the container it must not be reflected to my actual host data and at the same time
           keeping the behaivior of HOT_Reload we just add the (:ro) = read only
           still an issue if i delete something from the host it will be deleted inside my container does not make sense.
    _> ANONYMOS VOLUME
        -v $(pwd -v targetDirectory)
        _> to make a repo anonymos and tell the container that there is noting that makes the linking with it
    __>SOLUTION:
        there a lot of issues, the practical way of solving it is very simple we place all important files inside a directory called (src/)
        and after that we will need to bind only this folder

Docker Compose:
----------------
is a docker utility that comes with docker it help manage containers in a smooth and clean way. It is not included in docker itself
it is independent and it has it's own version...
"Docker Compose helps with defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to specify the services, networks, and volumes in a single file, making it easier to manage complex applications and their dependencies. With a simple configuration, you can deploy and scale your applications consistently across different environments."
    _> create a file called docker-compose.yml
        first thing we must specify the 
        version version: "3"
        services:
            available apps
            container-name: test_App
            volumes:
Basically we are doing the same thing just instead of doing it manually the docker compose simplify that for us
you can even call the docker file from the docker compose.

Environment Variables:
-----------------------
like any program you must include env variables to the runing app you can do that by including it in the docker command
or easily including it inside the docker-compose under the environment variable.
if you have many env variables you can pass them inside a file .env "env_file:"

Docker Environments (Dev, Prod, ...)
------------------------------------
the most commun  way and the docs of docker tell that it is advisable to use the .env file to store ur env variable 
it must be separeted for everything :
    _> docker-compose-ref.yml   -> use it for reference
    _> docker-compose-dev.yml   -> use it for developement version
    _> docker-compose-prod.yml   -> use it for production version
to make thing more cleaner.
    to run docker with a specific file:
    use -> docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
we can also use a default one for the commun data and use the others for only the changes

Multi-Stage Dockerfile:
-----------------------
we can do the same as the previous by having multiple docker files inside the project. but the better solution is

HOW TO MAKE CONTAINERS COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER 
---------------------------------------------------
docker inpect gives you details and informations about the running container...

_>  docker run -it jturpin/hollywood hollywood -> film hackers console....

Docker :
--------
_> isolated process.

Cgroups:
    kernel limit recources, and keep track 
Namespaces:
    to limit a process access and make it a jail process.
    
docker ps       =>        list the running containers
docker ps -a    ->        list all containers
docker run -it  _>        inter active mode
docker run -d   _>        detach mode
binding the container port 
    docker run -d -p6000:6794

Debugging :
    docker ps
    docker logs [container_id]

docker run -d -p6000:6794 --name test container

use docker exec to get the terminal of your already running container 
    docker exec -it [container] /bin/bash

docker start -> works with containers 
docker run  -> create a container from an image

DOCKER NETWORKING:
----------------------
docker network ls
docker network create mongo-network

Purging All Unused or Dangling Images, Containers, Volumes, and Networks
    Docker provides a single command that will clean up any resources â€” images, containers, volumes, and networks â€” that are dangling (not tagged or associated with a container):
        docker system prune
    To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:
        docker system prune -a

**********************************************OPENSSL**************************************************

1 - first of all we must init the folder that hold this certificates 
    mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
2 - give this folder the required permissions
    chmod   700 /etc/nginx/ssl


--------------------- CEARTE CERTIFICATE------------------------------------------

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/inception.key \
        -out /etc/nginx/ssl/inception.crt -subj "/C=MA/L=BENGUERIR/O=1337/OU=1337/CN=aelkhali.42.fr/UID=aelkhali"

openssl documentation :
    -x509 option is used togenerate a self-signed certificate.
    -subj "/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=value2/..."
        each type-value pair represents a component of the distinguished name. The common types include:
        /C=: Country Name (e.g., US for the United States).
        /L=: Locality Name (City).
        /ST=: State or Province Name.
        /O=: Organization Name.
        /OU=: Organizational Unit Name.
        /CN=: Common Name (typically the fully qualified domain name for SSL/TLS certificates).

    -nodes option in OpenSSL is used to indicate that the private key file being created should not be encrypted with a passphrase.
    <Keep in mind that using the -nodes option means that anyone with access to the private key file can use it without providing a passphrase. 
    Therefore, you should be cautious when using unencrypted private keys, especially in production environments or when dealing with sensitive 
    information. If security is a concern, it's generally better to use passphrase-protected private keys and implement secure key management practices.>

----------------------- END CREATING THE CERTIFICATE-----------------------------

now we make nginx ready to accept those keys and use them by telling him to check the new config file

1- create a config file inside -> /etc/nginx/conf.d/test.conf
2- add this two directives to your config file:
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;

an example config file to base on :

    server
    {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name aelkhali.42.fr;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.key;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;

        root /var/www/;

        location / {
            root /var/www/;
            index index.php;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
        }
    }


Docker Volumes and HOT RELOAD:
-------------------------------
    one of the most important thing in docker is volumes and how we can listen to files changes from the host 
    or from the container itself, and how we can transfer run time data from a running container to our host machine because 
    anything happened to the container (means a prune to the data it holds) suppose we are running a database server contianer we must save this data somewhere...as we know this container is just a running process that uses RAM memory if it stops we will not find anything...

syntax for docker volumes:
    -v  host_directory : container_directory [flag]
    
    -v: to tell docker we will add a volume
    host_directory: used to save or transfer data during run time of container
    container_directory : used to store data inside the container 
    [flag] -> used to tell docker the permission

the first one and it is the famous one it two way binding:
    when we are merroring a folder with the data inside a container for example:
        -v /app/data:/var/http/data
        -v   host_folder:container_data 
    the issue with this is if someone deleted the data folder inside the container and we are listening to it using the two way binding 
    it will be deleted from our host so we must think of limiting this access....

we must limit this full access and this will take us to the new solution -> the one way binding
-> we listen to the container data folder and we limit it's access to the folder we are mirroring the data inside
    example:
        -v /app/data:/var/http/data:ro  -> ro = read only
    now if we are inside the container and inside /var/http/data and we try to delete/create something it will not be possible
        -> this file system has read only access.

-> there still one issue after solving the previous one
    this one is very dangerous what if someone deleted the libraries from the host folder and the app inside the container depends on them this will create 
    a very big problem (container stop)
    this one can be solved by using "anonymos volumes" using the same previous syntax we add another -v to protect the important directories inside the container
    doing it this way:
        -v /app/data:/var/http/data:ro  -> ro -v /var/http/data/important

---> this what answer a very big question why people use such a hirachy to store it's application to make the binding simple
    if we use a src directory to store our app data only and let other thing outside we will make our binding easier and bind
    only the required src folder...

Docker-compose:
---------------
    is just a simple utility, that comes as an extension with docker, it does not do anything that we cannot do
    it just makes our like easier and help us manage and not write big commands to do a simple thing like building and running
    a container.
    without DC we must:
        1- build image manually
        2 - tag it manually
        3 - run a container
        ...
    docker compose simplify this process in a very short command like : docker-compose up
    -> depends_on:
        - depends_on does not wait for db and redis to be "ready" before starting web - 
        only until they have been started. If you need to wait for a service to be ready, 
        see Controlling startup order for more on this problem and strategies for solving it.
        The depends_on option is ignored when deploying a stack in swarm mode with a version 3 Compose file.


Environment Variables:
----------------------
    passing ENV is a must, because most apps uses env to configure.
    one of the way to pass an ENV to a container is by using the ENV keywoard
        "ENV example test" -> this if we are building an images throug docker file
    -> we can also pass an argument when we are running the container from the images by
        adding a flag :
        docker run -it --env PORT=4000 --env TEST=abdo debian:bullseye bash 
    but what if we have more than 20 ENV for example it is a bad idea to do it from the command as it will be painful
    for that we use .env file that will be passed to each container
    -> first we can store them inside a file and transfer this file to our container while starting it
        --env-file ./file_path
    -> we can also pass it to docker compose like this:
        environement:
            - PORT=value
            - TEST=NOTHING
        env_file:
            - ./env_path

DOCKR NETWORKS:
----------------
    using docker compose to run a set of containers will produce a default network for them
    you can inspect the network and everything using "docker inspect"
    or use:
         docker network ls
            ps -> there is some default networks that comes whith docker itself
    "every container of them has its own IP address but docker comes with a great solution like using domain name when browsing the web
    just use the name of the service and you can access it's IP directly" 

In the context of Docker and computer networking in general, a network refers to a collection of interconnected devices or nodes (such as computers, containers, or virtual machines) that can communicate and share resources with each other. A network can be physical, like a set of connected devices with cables, or it can be virtual, like a logical connection established between software entities.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts related to networks:

1. **Physical Network:**
   - **Hardware Components:** This includes physical devices such as routers, switches, and cables that enable communication between computers.

2. **Logical Network:**
   - **Software Abstraction:** Networks are often abstracted into logical entities to simplify management and configuration. In Docker, these logical entities are created and managed by Docker's networking features.

3. **Docker Network (Software Network):**
   - **Container Connectivity:** In the context of Docker, a network is a virtual space that allows containers to communicate with each other and with the external world.
   - **Software-Defined Networks (SDN):** Docker uses a software-defined networking approach to create, manage, and configure networks. This means that network configurations are handled through software rather than relying solely on physical hardware.

4. **Creation of Docker Networks:**
   - **Bridge Networks:** When you run a Docker container without specifying a network, it is connected to the default bridge network. You can also create custom bridge networks with specific configurations, such as subnet and gateway settings.
   - **Host Networks:** Containers can be connected to the host's network namespace, sharing the host's network stack. This is done using the `--network=host` option.
   - **Overlay Networks:** These are used for connecting containers running on different Docker hosts. This is particularly useful in distributed applications. Docker Swarm and Kubernetes often utilize overlay networks.
   - **Macvlan Networks:** These networks give containers their own MAC addresses, allowing them to appear as physical devices on the network.

5. **Container Communication:**
   - Containers within the same Docker network can communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames or through IP addresses.
   - Docker provides DNS resolution for container names within the same network.

6. **External Connectivity:**
   - Containers can be exposed to the external network through port mappings, allowing access to services running inside the containers.

In summary, a network, in the context of Docker and general computing, is a means of connecting and enabling communication between devices. Docker provides software-defined networking capabilities that allow containers to be part of virtual networks, and these networks can be customized based on specific requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> PID 1 and the best practices for writing Dockerfiles.

### PID 1 (Process ID 1):

In traditional Unix systems, PID 1 represents the first process started by the kernel during the boot process. This process is crucial because it has special responsibilities, including reaping orphaned child processes and responding to signals. In the context of Docker containers, the PID 1 process is significant because it determines how signals are handled within the container.

When a container starts, the process specified in the Dockerfile as CMD or ENTRYPOINT becomes PID 1. However, there is a key difference between PID 1 in a container and PID 1 on a host system. PID 1 in a container doesn't have the same responsibilities as the init system on a host.

Here are some best practices related to PID 1 in Docker containers:

1. **Signal Handling:**
   - PID 1 in a container should be able to handle signals correctly. For example, it should gracefully handle a SIGTERM signal to allow for a clean shutdown when the `docker stop` command is issued.

2. **Avoid Running as a Daemon:**
   - It's generally recommended not to run your main application process as a daemon in the foreground. Running the process in the foreground allows it to receive signals and respond appropriately.

3. **Use Exec Form in CMD/ENTRYPOINT:**
   - When specifying the CMD or ENTRYPOINT in your Dockerfile, consider using the exec form to run the command directly. This form replaces the shell process with the specified command, avoiding the creation of an additional process.

### Dockerfile Best Practices:

When writing Dockerfiles, there are several best practices to ensure efficient, secure, and maintainable container images:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images:**
   - Start with a minimal base image that contains only the necessary components for your application. This helps reduce the image size and potential security vulnerabilities.

2. **Layering:**
   - Utilize Docker's layer caching mechanism to optimize image builds. Place frequently changing or updating instructions at the end of the Dockerfile to take advantage of caching.

3. **Clean Up After Each Step:**
   - Remove unnecessary files and dependencies after each step in your Dockerfile to minimize the final image size.

4. **COPY Before Installing Dependencies:**
   - When copying files into the image, do it before installing dependencies. This way, you can take advantage of caching if the dependencies haven't changed.

5. **Use Non-Root User:**
   - Run your application as a non-root user to enhance security. Avoid running processes as the root user whenever possible.

6. **Specify Version Numbers:**
   - Specify version numbers for your base images and dependencies to ensure reproducibility and avoid unexpected changes.

7. **Combine RUN Commands:**
   - Combine multiple RUN commands into a single line using && to minimize the number of layers in the image.

8. **Label Your Images:**
   - Add labels to your images to provide metadata and information about the image.

By following these best practices, you can create Docker images that are efficient, secure, and easier to maintain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Let's delve into each of these points:

### 1. Avoid Running as a Daemon:

When it's mentioned to avoid running your main application process as a daemon, it means that you should not background the main process using the traditional daemonizing mechanisms (e.g., appending `&` at the end of a command or using tools like `nohup`). Instead, you should let the main process run in the foreground. The primary reasons for this recommendation are:

- **Signal Handling:** Running a process in the foreground allows it to receive signals properly. In Docker, signals are crucial for managing the lifecycle of a container. For example, when you run `docker stop` or `docker restart`, a SIGTERM signal is sent to the main process of the container. If the process is running in the foreground, it can catch and handle the signal gracefully.

- **Clean Shutdown:** When the main process runs in the foreground, Docker has better control over the termination of the container. This ensures that the application has an opportunity to shut down gracefully, clean up resources, and release any locks or stateful data.

- **Logging:** Running in the foreground simplifies logging. The logs of a foreground process are directly visible in the container's standard output and standard error streams, which makes it easier to capture and manage logs.

### 2. Use Exec Form in CMD/ENTRYPOINT:

In a Dockerfile, the CMD or ENTRYPOINT instruction specifies the command that will be run when a container is started. The choice between CMD and ENTRYPOINT depends on whether you want to provide default arguments or enforce a specific command.

When it comes to using the exec form in CMD or ENTRYPOINT, it means specifying the command directly without involving a shell process. Here's a comparison:

- **Shell Form:**
  ```Dockerfile
  CMD npm start
  ```

- **Exec Form:**
  ```Dockerfile
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  ```

The key advantages of using the exec form include:

- **Signal Propagation:** The exec form ensures that signals are directly sent to the specified command, without the interference of a shell process. This is important for proper signal handling and graceful shutdown.

- **Avoiding Shell Features:** The exec form avoids potential issues related to shell features (e.g., variable substitution, shell meta-characters) that might cause unexpected behavior.

- **PID 1 as the Executed Command:** When using the exec form, the command becomes the PID 1 process of the container. This is important for signal handling, especially for proper termination when signals like SIGTERM are sent to the container.

In summary, avoiding the daemon mode and using the exec form in CMD/ENTRYPOINT contribute to better signal handling, graceful shutdown, and overall improved container behavior in the Docker environment.

for example:
Yes, exactly! Your example uses the exec form in the CMD instruction and follows the best practice of running the main process (in this case, Nginx) in the foreground rather than as a daemon. Here's a breakdown of your CMD instruction:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- **Exec Form:** The command is specified in the exec form using a JSON array. Each element of the array represents an argument to the command.

- **Nginx Command:** The main process to be executed is `nginx`.

- **"-g daemon off;" Argument:** The argument passed to Nginx is `-g daemon off;`. This argument instructs Nginx to run in the foreground and not as a daemon. The `daemon off;` configuration ensures that Nginx doesn't detach and remains in the foreground, allowing Docker to manage signals and the container's lifecycle more effectively.

By using this approach, your Nginx process will run in the foreground, allowing Docker to properly handle signals and enabling a cleaner shutdown when necessary. This is a good practice for running processes within Docker containers.

How docker works under the hood ?
-----------------------------------
docker only virtualize the following 6 namespaces:
    mnt/file system
